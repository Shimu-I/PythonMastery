## Tracking My Progress

To track my reading and learning progress, this repository uses a structured folder system. Each book has its own folder, and within each folder, Iâ€™ll maintain a `README.md` file to log my progress by chapter or section, along with key takeaways or projects.

### Folder Structure
```
python-learning-path/
â”œâ”€â”€ python-crash-course/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pcc.md
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ chapter-1/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ example.py
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ notes.md
â”œâ”€â”€ automate-the-boring-stuff-with-python/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ absp.md
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ section-1/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ script.py
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ notes.md
â”œâ”€â”€ ...
â””â”€â”€ README.md (Main file) ðŸ‘ˆ (right now i am here)
```

### Tips for Success
- **Read Sequentially**: Follow the book order to build skills progressively.
- **Practice Actively**: Implement code examples and projects from each book. Store them in the respective chapter/section subfolders.
- **Document Thoroughly**: Use `notes.md` to summarize key concepts or challenges, making it easier to review later.
- **Commit Daily**: Small, consistent commits help track your progress and build a habit.

This structure keeps my learning organized, showcases my progress on GitHub, and makes it easy to revisit concepts or share my journey with others.
