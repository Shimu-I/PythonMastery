## Tracking My Progress

To track my reading and learning progress, this repository uses a structured folder system. Each book has its own folder, and within each folder, I maintain a `README.md` file to log my progress by chapter or section, along with key takeaways or projects.

### Folder Structure

```text
python-learning-path/
├── 01-python-crash-course-eric-matthes/
│   ├── pcc.md
│   ├── chapter-1 (Getting started)/
│   │   ├── example.py
│   │   └── notes.md
│   ├── chapter-2 (Variables and simple data types)/
│   │   ├── example.py
│   │   └── notes.md
│   └── ...
├── 02-automate-the-boring-stuff-al-sweigart/

│   ├── section-1/
│   │   ├── script.py
│   │   └── notes.md
│   └── ...
├── ...
└── README.md  (main file)

```

### Tips for Success
- **Read Sequentially**: Follow the book order to build skills progressively.
- **Practice Actively**: Implement code examples and projects from each book. Store them in the respective chapter/section subfolders.
- **Document Thoroughly**: Use notes.md to summarize key concepts or challenges, making it easier to review later.
- **Commit Daily**: Small, consistent commits help track my progress and build a habit.

This structure keeps my learning organized, showcases my progress on GitHub, and makes it easy to revisit concepts or share my journey with others.
