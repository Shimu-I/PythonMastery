(Book || Pdf) = (13 || 51)   

exercise  
 1-1. python.org: Explore the Python home page (https://python.org) to find top
ics that interest you. As you become familiar with Python, different parts of the 
site will be more useful to you.  

 1-2. Hello World Typos: Open the hello_world.py file you just created. Make a 
typo somewhere in the line and run the program again. Can you make a typo 
that generates an error? Can you make sense of the error message? Can you 
make a typo that doesn’t generate an error? Why do you think it didn’t make  
an error?  

 1-3. Infinite Skills: If you had infinite programming skills, what would you build? 
You’re about to learn how to program. If you have an end goal in mind, you’ll 
have an immediate use for your new skills; now is a great time to write brief 
descriptions of what you want to create. It’s a good habit to keep an “ideas” 
notebook that you can refer to whenever you want to start a new project. Take  
a few minutes now to describe three programs you want to create.

## Part II (Variables And Simple Data Types)
(Book || Pdf) = (19 || 57, 25 || 63, 29 || 67, 30 || 68, 31 || 69)  

exercise  
 2-1. Simple Message: Assign a message to a variable, and then print that 
message.  

 2-2. Simple Messages: Assign a message to a variable, and print that message. 
Then change the value of the variable to a new message, and print the new 
message.  

2-3. Personal Message: Use a variable to represent a person’s name, and print 
a message to that person. Your message should be simple, such as, “Hello Eric, 
would you like to learn some Python today?”  

 2-4. Name Cases: Use a variable to represent a person’s name, and then print 
that person’s name in lowercase, uppercase, and title case.  

 2-5. Famous Quote: Find a quote from a famous person you admire. Print the 
quote and the name of its author. Your output should look something like the 
following, including the quotation marks:
 Albert Einstein once said, “A person who never made a mistake never 
tried anything new.”  

 2-6. Famous Quote 2: Repeat Exercise 2-5, but this time, represent the famous 
person’s name using a variable called famous_person. Then compose your mes
sage and represent it with a new variable called message. Print your message.  

 2-7. Stripping Names: Use a variable to represent a person’s name, and 
include some whitespace characters at the beginning and end of the name. 
Make sure you use each character combination, "\t" and "\n", at least once.
 Print the name once, so the whitespace around the name is displayed. 
Then print the name using each of the three stripping functions, lstrip(), 
rstrip(), and strip().  

 2-8. File Extensions: Python has a removesuffix() method that works exactly  
like removeprefix(). Assign the value 'python_notes.txt' to a variable called 
filename. Then use the removesuffix() method to display the filename without 
the file extension, like some file browsers do.  

 2-9. Number Eight: Write addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division 
operations that each result in the number 8. Be sure to enclose your operations 
in print() calls to see the results. You should create four lines that look like this:
 print(5+3)
 Your output should be four lines, with the number 8 appearing once on 
each line.  

 2-10. Favorite Number: Use a variable to represent your favorite number. Then, 
using that variable, create a message that reveals your favorite number. Print 
that message.  

 2-11. Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and 
add at least one comment to each. If you don’t have anything specific to write 
because your programs are too simple at this point, just add your name and the 
current date at the top of each program file. Then write one sentence describing 
what the program does.
